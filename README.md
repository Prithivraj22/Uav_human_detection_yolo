## 📖 Overview

This project processes video from a drone camera and detects humans in real time using the YOLOv3 model. It's useful for:
- Defense & surveillance
- Disaster response
- Crowd monitoring

**Features:**
- Fast and accurate detection
- Works with video files or live feed
- Optimized for aerial views

## 🧠 How YOLOv3 Works

YOLOv3 detects objects in a single pass using deep learning. It:
- Divides the image into a grid
- Predicts bounding boxes and object classes
- Works at 3 different scales
- Uses Non-Max Suppression to remove duplicate detections

Ideal for real-time scenarios like drone footage.

## 📂 What is COCO Format?

COCO (Common Objects in Context) is a standard format for object detection datasets.

It includes:
- `images`: Image info
- `annotations`: Bounding boxes & class IDs
- `categories`: Object class names (e.g., "person")

We use the **"person"** class to detect humans.
